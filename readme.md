# Coding Katas

General coding practice to get better at algorithms. Also, great inspiration for setting 
coding tests for candidates. As they're all about 10 - 50 minutes work.

## Exercises

- find in array - can you sum sequential numbers in an array to a target.
- boggle - can you spell a word from a 2d array of letters boggle style.
- profit - can you find the in-order, largest difference (profit!) on an array, without an O(n^2) algorithm.
- euclide - Implement Euclid's algoithm for finding common factors of 2 numbers
- binary search - Simple binary search exercise that find a value in a sorted array
- largest common subsequence - What common sequences of non-sequential nodes are in an array
- look and say - Generate the look and say sequence: 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, etc
- n edits - Are two string only 1 edit apart
- population - What year are the most people alive
- spiral array - Given an array width, generate a 2d array, and populate a spiral of values
- string perms - Given a string s, and larger b, does any permutation of s appear in b.
- suffix array - Binary search through an array of words
