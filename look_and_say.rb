#Â Look and Say numbers:
# 1 = one 1 => 11
# 11 = two 1s => 21
# 21 = one 2, one 1 => 1211
# 1211 = one 1, one 2, two 1s => 111221
# And so on... Trivial, but tricky to get right.
#
# And enhancement on the below is to add a better data structure and go from there.
# For example, a hash of { ordinal: '1', count: 3 }, so it's a little easier to do things to,
# but takes up more memory. That said, in many languages appedning to string is memory intensive.

10.times do

    else
      new_s << "#{counter}#{current}"
      counter = 1
