# Coding Katas

General coding practice to get better at algorithms. Also, great inspiration for setting 
coding tests for candidates. As they're all about 10 - 50 minutes work.

## Exercises

- find in array - can you sum sequential numbers in an array to a target.
- boggle - can you spell a word from a 2d array of letters boggle style.
- profit - can you find the in-order, largest difference (profit!) on an array, without an O(n^2) algorithm.
- euclide - Implement Euclid's algoithm for finding common factors of 2 numbers
- binary search - Simple binary search exercise that find a value in a sorted array
- largest common subsequence - What common sequences of non-sequential nodes are in an array
